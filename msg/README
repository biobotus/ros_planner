The Num.msg is written as :
String
String
String
Float32
Float32
Float32

Which describes the name of the module, its x,y and z coordinates.
Both int8 at the end of file is to identify column and line size of certain boxes
(it can be ignore)
To make sure that the msg file is turned into source code for C++, Python, 
and other languages :
Open package.xml and make sure these two lines are in it :

<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
<run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>

Open CMakeLists.txt

Add the message_generation dependency to the find_package call which already
 exists in your CMakeLists.txt so that you can generate messages. You can do
 this by simply adding message_generation to the list of COMPONENTS such that
 it looks like this:


# Do not just add this to your CMakeLists.txt, modify the existing text to add message_generation before the closing parenthesis
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
   roscpp
   rospy
   std_msgs
   message_generation
)
